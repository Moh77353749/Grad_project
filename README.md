# Development of Lithium-Ion Battery Management System for Electric Vehicles using model-based approch

📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of a Battery Management System (BMS) for lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs). A key aspect of the project is the estimation of the State of Health (SOH) of the battery, which plays a critical role in predicting battery lifespan, optimizing performance, and maintaining battery safety.

The project incorporates advanced modeling techniques, simulations, and experimental validation to achieve a robust, reliable, and efficient BMS design focused on SOH estimation.
